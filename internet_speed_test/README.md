This script is designed to measure internet speed using the speedtest library in Python.

The script sets up logging to provide information about the speed test process and any errors that occur.
The measure_internet_speed() function encapsulates the speed test logic, handling exceptions that may occur during the test.
After measuring the speeds, the script checks if the speeds are valid and logs the results accordingly.

To use this script:

1. Ensure the speedtest library is installed (pip install speedtest-cli).
2. Save the script to a file, for example, internet_speed_test.py.
3. Run the script using python internet_speed_test.py in UNIX or Windows Terminal
4. Check the console output for internet speed results and any error messages.
